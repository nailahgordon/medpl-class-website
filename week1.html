    <h1>In Plato's Cave – Reflection</h1>

    <p>
        This page contains my reflection on "In Plato's Cave" and how images
        and media shape our understanding of reality.
        
        Reading “In Plato’s Cave” honestly made me stop and rethink how much photography controls the way I see things. 
        Before this, I never really questioned photos. If I saw something in an image, I automatically believed it or felt like I understood it. 
        Sontag made me realize that a lot of the time, I’m not actually understanding what’s going on I’m just reacting to an image.

        One thing that really stuck with me was her idea that photographs feel more truthful than words, even though they’re still someone’s version of reality. 
        I feel like that’s especially true now with social media. People post pictures and we assume that’s the full story, when in reality it’s just one moment, one angle, or one choice. 
        Sontag helped me see that photographs don’t show the whole truth they just feel like they do, which might be even more dangerous.

        Her discussion about photographing suffering was uncomfortable but real. 
        She explains that when people constantly see images of pain, violence, and tragedy, it can actually make them feel less emotional over time. 
        I see this all the time online. There are images of war, poverty, and death everywhere, and instead of feeling motivated to act, it sometimes just feels overwhelming or distant. 
        You scroll past it because it’s too much, or because it feels normal now. That part made me realize how exposure doesn’t always equal awareness.

        Another part I connected with was when she talks about photography replacing real experience. 
    I    I’ve noticed that when people go places or do something exciting, the first instinct is to take pictures. 
        Sometimes it feels like the moment doesn’t even matter unless it’s documented. 
        Sontag made me question whether photography actually helps us enjoy experiences or if it distracts us from being present. 
        A lot of the time, it feels like we’re more focused on proving we were there than actually being there.

        What I appreciated most about Sontag is that she doesn’t completely reject photography. 
        She just makes it clear that it has consequences. Photos can inform us, but they can also make us passive. 
        They can make us feel like we’ve done something just by looking.
        After reading this, I feel more aware of how easily images influence my emotions and opinions. 
        I’m definitely more cautious now about assuming that seeing a photograph means I truly understand what’s behind it.
